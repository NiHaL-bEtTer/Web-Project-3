Meaning Behind The Colors I chose is..... :
    I chose warm color palette that insists of dark red , a lighter red, light cream, and a golden cream. For Dark Mode I use a charcoal color as the background
    I think both cream colors perfectly complement the reds and provide eccellent contrast.
    I chose this warm mainly analougous color palette as Truth and Reconciliation is symbolized by The color orange, which is a warm color,
    the red river metis are also symbolized by  a dark red color, these are the people who also live in the treaty 1 area
